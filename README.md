# Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm To Accurately Predict Credit Card Approvals

### The data for this exercise was obtained from Kaggle. We have feature information like age, zip code , family members, mortgage, etc. and we also have credit card information which is our target variable. Our goal in this exercise is to build a machine Learning model using binary tree to segregate our population into "issue credit card" vs "non-issue of credit card". 

We follow the steps listed below for this project:
<li>We first start by cleaning our dataset, checking for NAs and removing unwanted columns. 
<li>Standardize the data
<li>split data into training and testing data sets.
<li>Create decision tree model
<li>Check classificaiton report and confusion matrix
<li>Change tree classification depth and re-evaluate accuracy.
<li>Use Support Vector Classification (SVC) to create model for comparison
<li>Change hyper-parameters for both (SVC + DT) to check if there is any improvement in accuracy.


## In this notebook, we have successfully demonstrated the implementation of 2 supervised ML algorithms, Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Decision Tree (DT) to build a model to predict if a person qualifies for credit card or not.
